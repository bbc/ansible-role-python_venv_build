# Required variables
#

# The path where venvs are extracted to
# on the target host during an install, for example:
# venv_install_destination_path: "/openstack/venvs/myvenv"

#
# Optional variables
#

# Distribution packages which must be installed
# on the host for the purpose of building the venv.
venv_build_distro_package_list: []

# Distribution packages which must be installed
# on the host when installing the venv.
venv_install_distro_package_list: []

# Set the package install state for packages
# Options are 'present' and 'latest'
venv_distro_package_state: "latest"
venv_pip_package_state: "latest"

# The time in seconds that the distribution package
# cache is valid for. This is only used by the apt
# and zypper package managers.
venv_distro_cache_valid_time: 600

# Python packages which must be installed
# into the venv.
venv_pip_packages: []

# Arguments to pass to pip when installing into the venv
venv_pip_install_args: ""

# The python executable to use for creating the venv
venv_python_executable: "python2"

# Enable the ability to *only* do the build, so that
# the build host can be pre-populated with the venvs.
venv_build_only: no

# Enable the packaging of venvs, so that they can
# be used for installation.
venv_build_package: yes

# Enable the use of wheels to speed up the venv
# build process, especially when building multiple
# venvs.
venv_build_wheels: yes

# The path where the wheels are cached on the build host
# for speeding up the build process.

# The path where the venvs are archived on the build host
# to be reused for installations.
venv_build_archive_path: "{{ lookup('env', 'HOME') }}/archive/venvs"

# The path where a built venv is sourced from when
# installing. If the path set begins with https(s)://
# then the install process will recognise the source
# is a web server. Otherwise the path is assumed to
# be on the deployment host.
venv_install_source_path: "{{ lookup('env', 'HOME') }}/archive/venvs"

# The facts to set when the venv changes during a
# build, or the installation of a venv.
# Eg:

#   - section: glance
#     option: venv_tag
#     value: "{{ glance_venv_tag }}"
venv_facts_when_changed: []

# The INI file name to use for the fact setting.
