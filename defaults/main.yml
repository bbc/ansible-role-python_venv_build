# Required variables

# The path where venvs are extracted to
# on the target host during an install, for example:

# Optional variables
#

# Distribution packages which must be installed
# on the host for the purpose of building the venv.
distro_package_list: []

# Set the package install state for packages
# Options are 'present' and 'latest'

# The time in seconds that the distribution package
# cache is valid for. This is only used by the apt
# and zypper package managers.

# Python packages which must be installed

# Enable the reuse of venvs across multiple hosts.
# This sets the build process to copy the venv to
# the deployment host once it's built, then to
# re-use the venv in subsequent deployments.

# Enable the ability to *only* do the build, so that
# the deploy host can be pre-populated with the venvs.
venv_reuse_build_only: no

# The path where a built venv should be stored on the
# deployment host. By default, ensure that the location
# separates venvs per distribution and architecture to
# prevent re-use of venvs between them.

# NOTE(hwoarang): ansible_distribution may return a string with spaces

# The facts to set when the venv changes during a
