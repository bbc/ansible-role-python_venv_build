# To ensure that only the first host in every distro/architecture
# group does the build, and the others make use of that build,
# without forcing the use of serialisation, we use a dynamic
# group based on the venv_reuse_download_subfolder which combines
# the distribution/architecture and is therefore unique for mixed
# environments.
